Progress
Testing:
1. sclera feature extraction function
    - integral image
    - average intensity u
    - standard deviation sigma
2. group features into a vector
3. sclera feature vector -> neural networks -> sclera image S1
4. iris feature extraction function
    - 4 Proportion of S1
5. sclera + iris feature vector -> neural networks -> iris image S2
6. S2 -> find center of S2 -> centerX,Y C
7. S2, C -> get inner distance around the center -> distance vector d1 (domain 0~2pi)
8. d1 -> polynomial regression -> d1'
9. S2, C -> get outer distance around the center -> distance vector d2 (domain 0~2pi)
10. d2 -> polynomial regression -> d2'
11. input test image, C, d1, d2 -> circle the iris region -> result image

Training:
1. get data set
2. separate taining images I1 and tesing image I2
3. draw correct answer images A1 for training ones
4. build neural network sturcture N (given random weights W and a threshold value V)
5. get feature vectors of I1 and put them into N to adjust W and V
...but how?

Fuction without machine learing
1. integral image
2. average intensity (different radii should be considered)
3. standard deviation (different radii should be considered)
4. proportion of a sclera (4 directions)
5. find center
6. get distance around the center (inner, outer)
7. polynomial regression (maybe matlab has it)
8. draw iris region
